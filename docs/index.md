# Analysis of COVID-19 GWAS summary statistics data

## Summary
This webpage will serve as a platform to post my analysis of COVID-19 GWAS
summary statistics data. I will work on the analyses part time, and plan to
update this webpage regularly.

The analyses I have in mind include:

* Basic analysis of the GWAS summary statistics data
* Genome-wide and local heritability and genetic correlation
* Trans-ethnic analysis assessing replicability of the potential associations

## Code
I will post the code I used to perform the analysis on my
[GitHub page](https://github.com/huwenboshi/covid).
